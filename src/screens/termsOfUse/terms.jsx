          <p>
            1. All commercial/contractual terms are offered by and agreed to

            cancel any such order placed by the Buyer, at its sole discretion

            the typical individual consumption. What comprises a typical
            individual's consumption quantity limit shall be based on various

          <h4>Disputes (Resolutions) Policy</h4>
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            Generally, transactions are conducted smoothly on Farm2Bag. However
            there may be some cases where both the Buyers and Sellers may face
            issues. At Farm2Bag, we have a Dispute Resolution process in order
            to resolve disputes between Buyers and Sellers.
          </p>
          <p>What is a 'dispute'?</p>
          <p>
            A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer and a
            Seller in connection with a transaction on the Platform.
          </p>
          <p>How does a 'dispute' occur in the Marketplace?</p>
          <p>
            Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer
            and the Seller. Disputes arise out of an issue that is raised by
            either party not being completely satisfied with the resolution of
            their complaint/issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they
            should attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer
            raises a dispute, the Seller's payment for that order is put on hold
            immediately until the issue is resolved.
          </p>
          <p>How is a 'dispute' created?</p>
          <p>
            Whenever there is a disagreement, the Buyer can write to
            dispute@Farm2Bag.com, while the Seller can write to ss@Farm2Bag.com,
            in order to raise a dispute. Disputes can be raised at a particular
            transaction level.
          </p>
          <p>What are the various types of 'disputes'?</p>
          <p>
            Following are the indicative examples of potential disputes: 1.
            Wrong item received 2. Item Not as described 3. Damaged or Seal
            broken on Product 4. Part/Accessory missing 5. Item not Compatible
            6. Seller Description/Specification Wrong 7. Defective (Functional
            issues) 8. Product not working and Manufacturer claims invalid
            Invoice{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            In case the Seller rejects the return request of the Buyer, and
            Buyer raises a dispute, then Farm2Bag will try to mediate and
            resolve the dispute between both the parties. If the dispute is
            resolved in favour of the Buyer, a refund is provided once the
            product is returned to the Seller. If the dispute is settled in
            favour of the Seller, Buyer is entitled to any refund.
          </p>
          <h4>Buyer Protection Program</h4>
          <p>
            In case of a dispute where the Seller is unable to provide a refund
            or a replacement, Farm2Bag will actively work towards reaching a
            resolution.
          </p>

          <p>

            Seller is not resolved. Farm2Bag's Customer Support team will look

            blacklisted/blocked from making purchases on the Platform. Only
            after verifying these facts, a dispute can be registered.
